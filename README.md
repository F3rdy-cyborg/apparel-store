## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone this Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

### 2. Local Development

Once cloned, open the `index.html` file in your browser to preview the website. You can make changes to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly in your local environment.

To start making edits:

1. Open `index.html` to modify the page structure and content.
2. Modify `style.css` to update the styles.
3. Add or update JavaScript in `script.js` for interactivity.

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

### 4. View on GitHub Pages

```
